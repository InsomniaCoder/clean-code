# clean-code

This repository is establised with the intention to summarize the content of the Clean code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Rober C. Martin.

I will read through this book chapter by chapter, pick what I think will be relevant to my work, and add in my opinion.

My purpose here is to only make my reading a bit more fun and get the most out of the reading, .... that's all..
